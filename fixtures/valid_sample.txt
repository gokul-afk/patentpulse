ABSTRACT
    A system and method for distributed consensus in a network of unreliable processors. 
    The system utilizes a leader-follower architecture where the leader coordinates 
    state updates across the cluster. In the event of a partition, a new leader 
    election protocol is triggered. This ensures high availability and consistency 
    specifically for time-series data ingestion pipelines.
